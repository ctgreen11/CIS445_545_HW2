    <h1>Reflection</h1>
    <p>
        As the end of my time at Bradley approaches, I look back at all the memories I made along the way. Due to the pandemic, my first year at Bradley was done online. This is where I took my first coding class and began my trying journey with CS and CIS. I hope that after my time at Bradley comes to a close, that I'll look back and say everything paid off.
